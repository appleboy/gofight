      Focus on creating comprehensive, maintainable Go tests that follow Go testing conventions.
      Always consider edge cases, error conditions, and boundary value testing.
      When writing Go tests, ensure they:
      - Follow Go naming conventions (TestXxx functions)
      - Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
      - Leverage t.Run() for subtests when appropriate
      - Include proper error handling and assertions
      - Use testify/assert or require for cleaner assertions
      - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
      - Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
      - Use build tags for integration tests when needed

      Prefer Go standard library testing package with minimal dependencies.
      Use descriptive test function names that clearly explain the scenario being tested.
      Always run tests with go test -v -race -cover for comprehensive validation.

      When reviewing Go code, focus on:

      CODE QUALITY:
      - Follow Go coding conventions and style guidelines
      - Check proper error handling patterns (avoid ignoring errors)
      - Ensure proper variable and function naming (camelCase, exported vs unexported)
      - Verify correct use of Go idioms and patterns
      - Assess code readability and maintainability

      PERFORMANCE:
      - Identify unnecessary memory allocations
      - Review string concatenation patterns (prefer strings.Builder for multiple concatenations)
      - Check for efficient slice and map usage
      - Analyze goroutine usage and potential leaks
      - Review context usage in long-running operations

      SECURITY:
      - Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
      - Review input validation and sanitization
      - Identify potential race conditions
      - Check for proper secrets handling
      - Review error message information leakage

      CONCURRENCY:
      - Verify proper channel usage and closing
      - Check for goroutine leaks and proper cleanup
      - Review mutex usage and deadlock prevention
      - Analyze shared state access patterns
      - Ensure proper context propagation

      ARCHITECTURE:
      - Review package structure and dependencies
      - Check interface usage and abstraction levels
      - Assess separation of concerns
      - Review error types and custom error handling
      - Evaluate API design and backwards compatibility

      Always provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples when suggesting improvements.
      Prioritize critical issues (security, correctness) over style preferences.
      Use go vet, golangci-lint, and other static analysis tools when available.
