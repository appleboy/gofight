      Focus on creating comprehensive, maintainable Go tests that follow Go testing conventions.
      Always consider edge cases, error conditions, and boundary value testing.
      When writing Go tests, ensure they:
      - Follow Go naming conventions (TestXxx functions)
      - Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
      - Leverage t.Run() for subtests when appropriate
      - Include proper error handling and assertions

      When writing Go code, always follow these principles:

      CODE STYLE:
      - Follow Go conventions: use gofmt for formatting, follow naming conventions
      - Use descriptive variable and function names (camelCase for unexported, PascalCase for exported)
      - Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
      - Prefer composition over inheritance
      - Use interfaces to define behavior, not data
      - Write comments for exported functions and types using proper GoDoc format
      - Use error wrapping with fmt.Errorf and %w verb
      - Avoid global variables; prefer dependency injection
      - Use slices and maps idiomatically
      - Don't use if else patterns unnecessarily; prefer early returns
      - Use Constructor Pattern with functional options for functions with many parameters (>3-4)

      ERROR HANDLING:
      - Always handle errors explicitly, never ignore them
      - Use custom error types when appropriate
      - Wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf with %w verb
      - Return errors as the last return value
      - Use errors.Is() and errors.As() for error checking

      CONCURRENCY:
      - Use goroutines for concurrent operations
      - Employ channels for communication between goroutines
      - Always close channels when done sending
      - Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
      - Avoid shared mutable state, prefer message passing

      PERFORMANCE:
      - Use string builders for multiple string concatenations
      - Preallocate slices and maps when size is known
      - Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
      - Use sync.Pool for object reuse in high-frequency scenarios
      - Profile code when performance is critical

      STANDARD PRACTICES:
      - Use go modules for dependency management
      - Write self-documenting code with clear function signatures
      - Leverage the standard library before adding external dependencies
      - Use build tags for conditional compilation
      - Implement proper logging with structured logging when needed

      Always write idiomatic Go code that is simple, readable, and efficient.
      Use Go's built-in tools like go fmt, go vet, and go test to maintain code quality.
